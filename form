site gives the details of the medicine like rate ,expiry date , company name and
the stock details also. It becomes very difficult in big pharmacy to handle the
details of all the medicines manually, so by using this pharmacy management
system We can maintain the records of all the medicines. Through this site
we can check the list of doctors on duty and if the patient have any complaint
about any medicine they can inform their complaint through this site.
